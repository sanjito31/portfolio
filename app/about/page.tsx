                <p className="m-4 text-center">I&apos;m a Computer Science graduate student at Columbia University specializing in Machine Learning. My journey began with a Microbiology degree from UCLA and biomedical research on Parkinson&apos;s disease and ALS at Cedars-Sinai.</p>
                <br />
                <p className="m-4 text-center">While analyzing thousands of microscopy images and complex datasets, I discovered my passion for AI and how machine learning could automate analysis and accelerate discoveries that help patients.</p>
                <br />
                <p className="m-4 text-center">Today, I focus on using technology to create meaningful impactâ€”particularly developing machine learning solutions to bridge brain signals and robotics, helping individuals with disabilities through intelligent prosthetics and assistive devices.</p>
